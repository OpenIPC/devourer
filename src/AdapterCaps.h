/* Aggregate adapter-capability report — what the opened radio actually IS and
 * what it can do, resolved from the chip identity devourer already determines at
 * construction (SYS_CFG2 chip-id + USB PID + EFUSE RF-type). A dependent app
 * (OpenIPC-FPV tooling, a link manager, a test harness) can enumerate the RF
 * frequency coverage, channel widths, spatial-stream / chain count, and the
 * per-family feature levers (per-packet TX power, narrowband, fast retune)
 * without hardcoding a chip table of its own or scraping bring-up logs.
 *
 * This is the identity+radio superset of the narrower GetTxCaps (modulation
 * features) and GetTxPowerCaps (power-knob range), which it composes by value so
 * there is one source of truth per fact. Like those, it is STATIC — resolved at
 * construction, safe from any thread, callable before Init/InitWrite. The live
 * "which antennas look connected" question is deliberately NOT here (it needs
 * traffic); see IRtlDevice::GetActiveRxPaths / ActiveRxPaths in RxQuality.h.
 *
 * FREQUENCY COVERAGE. The 5 GHz synthesizer on these parts tunes well past the
 * regulatory UNII channels (the vendor rtl88x2bu "monitor_chan_override" hack:
 * chan 16..253, freq = 5000 + 5*chan, ~5080..6165 MHz). devourer drives that
 * whole span in monitor mode; `tune_5g` reports the tunable range while
 * `characterized_5g` reports the sub-range backed by the generated txpwr_lmt /
 * EFUSE PG tables (outside it, per-channel constants and TX power are
 * extrapolated from the nearest characterized channel — the radio still tunes,
 * but power is uncalibrated). Regulatory compliance is the CALLER's problem: the
 * library enforces none.
