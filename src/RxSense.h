 * side of the DEVOURER_CW_TONE emitter: a coarse "how much in-band energy /
 * channel activity is here" measurement that does NOT require receiving a frame.
 *
 * Filled by IRtlDevice::GetRxEnergy() from the chip's phydm facilities:
 *   - false-alarm (FA) + CCA (channel-busy) counters,
 *   - the DIG initial-gain index (a noise-floor proxy),
 *   - and, where triggered, the NHM in-band power histogram.
 *
 * All values are channel-wide scalars — no Realtek 88xx chip exports
 * per-subcarrier CSI to the host, so this is energy, not a spectrum. Build a
 * coarse spectrum by sweeping channels/bins and sampling this per bin.
 *
 * FA/CCA counts are the DELTA since the previous GetRxEnergy() call (each read
 * resets the hardware counters), so a strong in-band carrier shows up as a jump
 * in cca_ofdm / fa_ofdm and a rise in igi. Every field carries a valid_* flag
 * because the facilities differ by chip generation. */
