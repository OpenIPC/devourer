/* BB-dbgport reader — exploration framework for the Realtek "Jaguar" PHY
 * debug port.
 *
 * STATUS: research dead-end as shipped. The transport (write u32 selector
 * to 0x8FC, read u32 result from 0xFA0 via libusb vendor control) works
 * and is wrapped here with the canonical save/restore pattern from
 * upstream's only in-tree user (hal/rtl8814a/rtl8814a_phycfg.c:460-545,
 * `phy_ADC_CLK_8814A`). What's MISSING is the selector that routes the
 * post-FFT per-subcarrier IQ bus to 0xFA0 — that selector lives in
 * Realtek's phydm sources, which are not vendored in this tree. Without
 * it, sweeping selectors gives raw BB internals (clock-domain status,
 * MAC_Active bits, BB busy flags) but not the IQ samples the precoder
 * README ("Tier 4") wants for shape verification.
 *
 * What this file provides is the FRAMEWORK so a researcher with access to
 * a phydm selector catalogue can plug in the right value at runtime and
 * read it back — without recompiling and without rediscovering the
 * save/restore + chip-alive plumbing.
 *
 * BRICK RISK
 *   Poking 0x8FC while RX is live can leave demod state machines spinning
 *   (cf. the MAC_Active busy-wait at rtl8814a_phycfg.c:475-479). The
 *   canonical save/restore wrapper used here is the only safe pattern.
 *   Recovery ladder if the chip stops responding to RX after a sweep:
 *     1. libusb_reset_device (set DEVOURER_SKIP_RESET=0 on next launch)
 *     2. USB port-level usbreset (tests/regress.py style)
 *     3. power-cycle / replug
 *   Symptoms are typically RX-stalls with control transfers still alive;
 *   no permanent damage observed in-tree, but treat first runs as
 *   destructive until proven otherwise.
 *
 * Gating: every helper is no-op unless an explicit env var is set in
 * demo/main.cpp. There is no automatic invocation — read+restore happens
 * only when a researcher asks for it.
