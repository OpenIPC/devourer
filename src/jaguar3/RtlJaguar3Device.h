 * RtlJaguarDevice (Jaguar1) and implements the same IRtlDevice contract so the
 * demos and WiFiDriver factory treat both uniformly.
 *
 * Bring-up is ported from Realtek vendor source (rtl88x2cu/phydm/halrf):
 * power-on, firmware download, MAC/BB/RF config, IQK and DACK drive RX,
 * channel/bandwidth (incl. 5/10 MHz narrowband) and on-air TX. send_packet is
 * on-air; sustained continuous TX is kept alive by the coex runtime thread
 * (coex_runtime_loop) — see CLAUDE.md. */
